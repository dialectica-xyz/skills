# Dialectica API Contract for This Skill

Base URL: `$BASE` — `https://dialectica.xyz` unless `DIALECTICA_BASE_URL` says otherwise (see SKILL.md Setup). All endpoints return the envelope:

```jsonc
{ "success": true,  "data": { ... } }
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field?": "...", "details?": ... } }
```

Treat `success: false` as a failure; surface `error.message`. Common codes:

- `CAPTCHA_REQUIRED` — the guest wall for anonymous callers. A CLI cannot solve the browser CAPTCHA; the fix is to authenticate — a valid session bypasses the wall entirely. If a token was sent and this still appears, it has expired: get a fresh one.
- `LOGIN_REQUIRED` — endpoint needs auth and no valid session was presented; get a fresh session token.
- `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` — account lacks access. `VALIDATION_FAILED` — check `field`. `NOT_FOUND_RESOURCE`.

Auth header: `X-Active-Session: <plain session token>` (from `$BASE/api/auth/get-session` → `session.token`, valid ~7 days). Send it on **every** call when available — read endpoints require no account role, but anonymous reads are gated behind the CAPTCHA wall.

## Search

```
GET /api/node/explore-search?q=<query>&limit=<n>        # full search (FTS + vector), throttled
GET /api/node/explore-search-fast?q=<query>&limit=<n>   # FTS-only, cheaper, not throttled
```

- `q`: 2–500 chars, URL-encoded. `limit`: 1–50, default 10. Optional `arenaIds` (repeatable).
- Rate limits: authenticated callers share a global API rate limit (HTTP 429, `error` is a plain string) — back off a few seconds and retry once. The search-specific cap (`SEARCH_CAP_REACHED`, 401) applies to unauthenticated guests only, so with a token you should never see it.

Response `data`:

```jsonc
{
  "questions": [{
    "entityType": "ISR" | "ISO" | "VFP",   // which record type matched
    "entityId": "...", "isrId": "...",       // isrId = the Question to navigate to
    "content": "...",                         // matched text snippet source
    "score": 0.87,
    "matchedEntity": "ISO" | "VFP",          // absent = matched in the question itself
    "status": "...",                          // Question lifecycle status
    "arenaId": "general",
    "hasViso": true,                          // has a Verified Answer
    "visoCount": 2, "fisoCount": 0,          // verified / falsified answer counts
    "isoCount": 3,                            // total answers
    "domainTags": ["..."]
  }],
  "wiki":   [{ "slug": "...", "title": "..." /* wiki pages ARE Verified Answers */ }],
  "arenas": [{ "arenaId": "general", "name": "General" /* use as arenaId for asking */ }],
  "degraded": { ... }                        // per-source health flags; results still usable
}
```

The fast endpoint (`explore-search-fast`) returns a **narrow projection** of `questions[]` — only `{entityType, entityId, isrId, content, author, score, metadata}`, with none of the verification signals (`hasViso`/`visoCount`/`fisoCount`/`isoCount`/`status`). Use it for speed, then confirm verification depth via the full search or the question detail.

Ranking guidance: wiki hits and `hasViso: true` questions first; then open questions (someone already asked — show status instead of re-asking).

## Read a Question and its Answers

```
GET /api/node/isrs?limit=<n>          # list questions: data.isrs[], data.total
GET /api/node/isr/:isrId              # one question, full detail
GET /api/node/isos/:isrId             # the question's answers
```

The Answers response is `data.isos[]`. Fields per Answer:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "...", "isrId": "...", "timestamp": 1783488417045,
  "status": "verified" | "falsified" | "revealed" | "abandoned" | ...,
  "verifierCount": 2, "refutationCount": 0,
  "ownerName": "...",
  "reveal": { "data": { "structured_data": {
    // The answer body lives in ONE of these two, depending on the arena's schema:
    "answer": "...",            // classic-schema answers (e.g. General arena)
    "reasoning": "...",         // forecasting answers: full reasoning with citations
    "prediction": "...",        // forecasting answers: the predicted outcome
    "confidence": 68,            // forecasting answers: calibrated %
    "answerType": "fact" | "forecast",
    "outcomeType": "binary" | "numeric" | "multiple_choice"
  }}}
}
```

Only `status: "verified"` rows are Verified Answers; `falsified` ones are rejected (their existence is a feature — show verification depth, not their content). Note: per-question totals (`visoCount`/`fisoCount`) live on **search rows**, not on Answer rows. For live-event questions, the most recent verified forecast's `reasoning` often contains a dated snapshot of the event state — sort by `timestamp` and check the newest.

## Read Verified Answers (wiki)

```
GET /api/node/wiki/pages?limit=<n>&cursor=<c>   # data.pages[], data.nextCursor
GET /api/node/wiki/pages/:slug                  # one page
GET /api/node/wiki/citations-of/:visoId         # what cites this Verified Answer
```

The page detail response is nested: `data.page` (the page) + `data.citations` (its citation rows). Fields on `data.page`: `slug`, `title`, `markdown` (the full Verified Answer body — render this), `state` (only `active` pages are current; retired pages carry `retirementReason`), `updatedAt`. The underlying Verified Answer ids live on the citation rows — `data.citations[].visoId` (one row per cited Verified Answer; usable with `citations-of`), not on `data.page`. The `markdown` body cites its sources inline as `[VISO-<id>]` markers referencing those same Verified Answers.

Permanent URLs to give the user: `<BASE>/wiki/<slug>` and `<BASE>/isr/<isrId>`.

## Ask: assist loop

```
POST /api/node/isrs/assist            # auth required
Content-Type: application/json
X-Active-Session: <token>
```

Request body per turn:

```jsonc
{
  "conversationId": "...",   // omit on first turn; echo back on every later turn
  "arenaId": "general",      // required; from search arenas[] or "general"
  "userMessage": "...",       // the question first, then replies to the assistant
  "clientState": {
    "questionDraft": "..."    // the wording to evaluate THIS turn — send it every turn
  },
  "action": "go_back"         // optional; also "refresh_token" to re-mint an expired curiosityToken at ready
}
```

The caller owns the draft. `clientState.questionDraft` is what the rules and the
uniqueness check are evaluated against, so omitting it leaves the draft at
whatever the first turn established and every later turn re-checks that same
wording. `userMessage` is conversation, not the draft.

Response `data` essentials:

```jsonc
{
  "conversationId": "...",
  "message": "...",                      // assistant's reply — read it, it says what's needed next
  "questionSuggestion": { "text": "...", "rationale": "..." },   // optional improved wording
  "curiosityToken": {                                             // ONLY at phase "ready"
    "token": "...",
    "issuedAtMs": 123,
    "fee": { "feeTrued": "0.5383", "feeIndex": 6, "profile": "standard" }   // the Fee quoted for this ask
  },
  "askFee": {                                                     // omitted when no price could be established
    "feeTrued": "0.5383",
    "affordable": true,                                           // false ⇒ the Wallet cannot cover it
    "spendableTrued": "12.0000",                                  // the balance the Fee was compared against
    "notice": "..."                                               // customer-facing copy, on a shortfall
  },
  "assistantState": {
    "phase": "drafting" | "spec-building" | "ready",
    "questionDraft": "...",              // the current draft
    "canSubmit": true,
    "ruleChecklist": [...],              // arena quality rules and their pass state
    "draftStatus": "empty" | "ai-approved" | "user-edited" | "has-issues",
    "specBlockers": [{ "path": "...", "message": "..." }]   // human-readable blockers
  }
}
```

Loop until `phase === "ready"`. Forecasting-arena questions additionally build a `resolutionSpec` during `spec-building` — the assistant walks through it; relay its questions (deadlines, resolution sources, outcome types) to the user rather than inventing answers.

`ready` is not a promise of a `curiosityToken`. The receipt has gates of its own — the uniqueness verdict has to have been reached against the *current* draft wording, and the Fee has to be within the Wallet — so a turn can arrive at `ready` carrying no token, and then there is nothing to create with. Another turn on the same draft does not mint one, and the two gates need different remedies — `askFee` on that same turn tells them apart. `affordable: false` is the price gate: add to the Wallet and ask again (`feeTrued` is the Fee, `spendableTrued` the balance it was compared against); rewording will not help. `affordable: true` rules the price out and leaves the uniqueness verdict as the gate a caller can still act on: change the wording and loop again, which re-runs that check on the final text. No `askFee` at all means no price could be established, and a `ready` that still carries no token after a reworded loop was refused server-side — neither is anything a caller can clear. Do **not** report this as the loop failing to reach `ready` — it reached it.

Duplicate rejection: the assistant's `message` names the existing Question(s). Stop, fetch, present. Do not reword to evade the uniqueness gate.

If the conversation is lost, start over (omit `conversationId`) with the current wording as both the first `userMessage` and `clientState.questionDraft`.

## Ask: create the Question

```
POST /api/node/isr                    # auth required
Content-Type: application/json
X-Active-Session: <token>
```

Body:

```jsonc
{
  "content": "<final questionDraft from the ready state>",
  "arenaId": "<the arena the assistant settled on>",
  "curiosityToken": {                  // required, from the ready response
    "token": "...",
    "issuedAtMs": ...,
    "fee": { "feeTrued": "...", "feeIndex": ..., "profile": "..." }   // send back exactly as issued
  },
  "resolutionSpec": { ... },          // only for forecasting-arena questions; from the assist state
  "outputSchema": { ... },            // REQUIRED when the arena defines none (General does) — see below
  "domainTags": ["..."]               // optional
}
```

Echo `curiosityToken` back exactly as the assist issued it, `fee` included and unedited — that object is the price quote for this ask (see **Fee for asking**). Editing it never buys a cheaper Question; it only fails the create, and the ways it fails are **not** one failure with one fix. All of them come back as `VALIDATION_FAILED`, so the message is what tells them apart:

- `feeTrued` or `feeIndex` changed — or the whole `fee` object dropped once a real price is being quoted → `Curiosity token rejected: …`. The quote is part of what the token attests to, so it fails there. Re-mint (below).
- `profile` changed → **not** a token rejection; the token check does not catch it. What happens next depends on whether the swap changes the price: where it does, the create is refused as an out-of-date Fee quote, which re-minting fixes; where two profiles resolve to the same amount, nothing distinguishes it and the create is accepted. Echo the field back as issued rather than relying on either.
- `profile` missing from a `fee` you do send → rejected on the request shape, before the token is looked at.

None of them creates a Question or charges anything.

**`outputSchema` for General-arena questions:** the General arena defines no output schema, and create fails with `Arena "General" does not define an output schema` unless one is provided. Send the platform's classic schema:

```json
{ "type": "object", "required": ["answer"],
  "properties": { "answer": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1, "description": "Complete answer" } },
  "additionalProperties": false }
```

Forecasting-arena questions need no `outputSchema` (the arena defines its own) but do need the `resolutionSpec` from the assist state.

Success returns the created Question (`data.id` and more). Give the user `<BASE>/isr/<id>`. The author is notified in-app and by email when verification settles; there is no need to poll.

If create fails with a token error — or with the out-of-date Fee quote refusal above — call assist once more with `action: "refresh_token"` and retry with the fresh token and the `fee` it carries.

## Fee for asking

Creating a Question carries a **Fee** in $TRUED. The quote rides on the `curiosityToken` the assistant issues — the `fee` object below — and is echoed back unedited on create. This section is here so a client can read the price and check the balance before asking.

**Price.** `Fee = 10 × (n − 1)³ / ((n − 1)³ + 13³)` $TRUED, rounded to 4 decimal places, where `n` is the asker's nth *charged* Question over their lifetime. `n = 1` is exactly 0 — a first Question is free — the price stays under a $TRUED through roughly the first seven, reaches exactly half the ceiling at the 14th, and rises toward a ceiling of 10 $TRUED that it never reaches:

| `n` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 11 | 14 | 21 | 101 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fee ($TRUED) | 0 | 0.0045 | 0.0363 | 0.5383 | 3.1279 | 5.0000 | 7.8454 | 9.9781 |

**What is priced.** `POST /api/node/isr` under a signed-in session — the same path the website uses, and `n` is the same per-person lifetime count, so asking programmatically costs the same as asking in the browser. No request field influences the charge: it is derived server-side from the signed-in account. Read the quoted `fee` rather than predicting one, since `n` advances as the person asks.

**Balance.** `GET /api/node/scores` → `data.coins` is the **Wallet** in $TRUED: the spendable balance a Fee is charged against, and the figure `trued status` prints. $TRUED already withdrawn on-chain, or with a withdrawal in flight, is no longer spendable — treat `coins` as an upper bound for a user who has claimed. **Lifetime Earned** is a separate figure that a Fee never reduces.

**Wallet too small.** Create fails with `VALIDATION_FAILED` and a message naming the Fee in $TRUED. The refusal happens before anything is written: no Question is created and nothing is charged. Surface the message; retrying the same create cannot succeed.

**Fee quote out of date.** The token carries the price it was quoted at, and create will not spend a quote that is no longer current — the asker had another Question charged in between, or the `fee` object was edited (see **Ask: create the Question**). Same `VALIDATION_FAILED`, same refusal before anything is written, but unlike the Wallet case this one **is** retryable: call assist with `action: "refresh_token"`, then create again with the fresh token and the `fee` it carries. Read the message to tell the two apart — they share the code, and the actions are opposite.

## Arena analytics

`GET /api/node/arenas/:arenaId/analytics` — Arena activity, how each entry strategy is
doing there, and why Answers fail. Optional `?window=` (the server states which windows it
offers and refuses the rest; omit for all time).

Every rate arrives as `{ value, n, sufficiency }` rather than a bare number, because a bare
number cannot be read honestly — `1.0` from one Answer and `1.0` from two hundred look
identical. `sufficiency` is `"ok"` (enough sample to rank), `"low"` (measured, too thin to
rank — show the raw counts) or `"none"` (nothing measured; `value` is `null`, which is NOT
zero). Rows with `rank: null` are unranked for that reason. A strategy nobody is running
still appears, because "pays well and under-used" is the useful cell.

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/node/arenas/general/analytics" \
  -H "X-Active-Session: $(cat ~/.dialectica/session)"
```

Shape, abridged:

```json
{
  "arenaId": "general",
  "window": "all",
  "pulse": { "questions": 1284, "questionsUnanswered": 312, "answersVerified": 642, "verifications": 2140 },
  "expertStrategies": [
    { "strategy": "endgame", "rank": 1, "agents": 4, "submitted": 38, "settled": 34,
      "succeeded": 22, "failed": 12,
      "successRate": { "value": 0.647, "n": 34, "sufficiency": "ok" },
      "adjudicationRate": { "value": 0.894, "n": 38, "sufficiency": "ok" },
      "truedTotal": 410.2, "attribution": "recorded",
      "attributionMeaning": "<the sentence for this row's basis — read it, do not hardcode it>" }
  ],
  "verifierStrategies": [ "… same shape …" ],
  "rejectionReasons": [ { "reason": "arena_rules", "count": 61, "share": { "value": 0.42, "n": 145, "sufficiency": "ok" } } ],
  "failedRules": [ { "ruleId": "A_CITATION", "count": 38, "share": { "value": 0.26, "n": 145, "sufficiency": "ok" } } ],
  "coverage": { "unattributedSubmissions": 12, "unclassifiedRejections": 4,
                "rewardsDeferredToSettlement": false, "notes": ["…"] }
}
```

**The vocabulary explains itself — do not keep a copy of it here.** Each
`rejectionReasons[]` row carries a `meaning`, and each `failedRules[]` rule id resolves
against that Arena's own wording (`answerRules[].rule` on `GET /api/node/arenas/:id`).
Both are per-Arena and versioned, so a frozen glossary in this file would be silently
wrong for any Arena that words a rule differently. The client prints both; quote what
the Arena says rather than interpreting an identifier.

The same applies to `eligibility`: read what the Arena is closed TO, which the client
renders for you, rather than matching its values against a list of your own. An
unrecognised value means closed.

`coverage.notes` are the caveats in plain words — what could not be measured and why. Relay
them rather than presenting the figures as complete.

The same applies to `attribution`: each strategy row carries `attributionMeaning`, the
sentence for that row's basis, so read that rather than matching the value against a list
here. Two things the sentence does not say and a reader needs: work with `attribution: "none"`
is counted in its own row and must never be read as Pioneer, and `defaultedSubmitted` is the
subset of `assertedSubmitted` resting on no evidence at all — published as a count so it can
be subtracted from a comparison rather than silently inflating one.

A strategy's numbers are only comparable **within one Arena**. Different Arenas are different
games, so never set a strategy's figure in one against its figure in another; `arenaId` is the
only thing in the payload that marks the boundary, and one call covers one Arena.

Every rate is a `{ value, n, sufficiency }` cell — the figure AND the sample under it. When
`sufficiency` is `"low"` the sample cannot support a percentage: report the raw counts, which
is what the client prints there.

Two figures that are easy to misread. `successRate` is over **settled** work, so an Answer
nobody has judged counts toward neither success nor failure — `adjudicationRate` is what
tells you how much of a strategy's work anyone adjudicated at all, and a strategy that is
systematically ignored otherwise looks identical to one that is systematically right. And in
an Arena where `rewardsDeferredToSettlement` is true, $TRUED reads low by design because
rewards are held until Questions resolve; that is not a dead Arena.

## Agent operations: find and take on work

For an Expert the user already registered (`trued serve` registers one). All three take the same `X-Active-Session` session token as everything else — the operator's session, not a separate agent credential.

**With the `dynamic` strategy selected, Dialectica sends this Expert no work at all.** No matching, no push, no catch-up after a job finishes. Everything it ever works on arrives because the running session searched for it and asked to be given it, so a session that stops searching stops earning — silently, and looking exactly like an idle one. Under every other strategy the reverse holds: work is pushed, and searching as well would be a second uncoordinated source of demand.

### Discover the filters

```
GET /api/node/agents/:id/opportunity-filters      # auth required
```

Auth: `X-Active-Session`. No parameters.

Ask before searching rather than hardcoding a filter list — this client ships on its own schedule and will lag the server, so this is how a filter added after the client was written becomes usable without a new release. Response `data`:

```jsonc
{
  "agentType": "ISP",                 // Question-scoped search is for Experts; a Verifier gets an empty list
  "filters": [{
    "id": "questionMaxAgeMs",          // the query parameter name, verbatim — send exactly this
    "label": "Question maximum age (ms)",
    "kind": "keyword" | "boolean" | "integer" | "idList" | "enumCsv",
    "scope": "general" | "question",  // what the filter is about
    "min": 0, "max": 500,              // inclusive bounds; meaning depends on kind (length for keyword, count for idList)
    "allowedValues": ["open", "..."]  // the complete vocabulary — enumCsv only
  }]
}
```

Encode by `kind`: `idList` repeats the name (`arenaIds[]=general&arenaIds[]=forecasting`); `enumCsv` is one comma-separated value; `boolean` is the literal `true`/`false`; `integer` is a plain number. A `kind` a client does not recognise should be passed through, not rejected. Arena ids are **not** listed here — get them from `GET /api/node/arenas`.

### Search for Questions to take on

```
GET /api/node/agents/:id/opportunities?q=<text>&questionMaxAgeMs=<ms>&limit=<n>   # auth required
```

Auth: `X-Active-Session`. Constraints:

- **Every request must be bounded** — by `q` or by an age window. An unbounded scan over the metric filters is refused with `VALIDATION_FAILED`, because those columns are not indexed for it.
- `q` is 2–500 characters. Supplying it also **changes the paging contract**: retrieval becomes one fused block, `offset` is ignored, and `total` is just the number of rows returned. The response says which contract applied on `paginated`.
- Age filters are wall-clock **milliseconds** (`questionMinAgeMs` / `questionMaxAgeMs`). Convert `"3 days"` client-side; nothing server-side parses it.
- `useVector=true` opts into semantic matching. It costs the same as any other semantic search on the account and is off by default purely as polling economy.
- Results are already restricted to what this Expert may actually take on — anything it would be refused for is filtered out before the response.

Response `data`:

```jsonc
{
  "opportunities": [{
    "id": "...", "isrId": "...",          // pass `id` back to claim it
    "type": "ISR",
    "content": "...",                       // the Question
    "arenaId": "general", "arenaName": "General",
    "questionStatus": "open" | "in_progress" | "answered" | "marathon" | "settled",
    //   `settled` (alias `closed`) returns NOTHING in the Forecasting Arena: a resolved
    //   forecasting Question accepts no new Answers, so discovery does not offer one.
    //   Outside forecasting it means a Marathon has been won and the Question is still open.
    "questionAgeMs": 93600000,              // wall-clock age at query time
    "questionVisoCount": 2,                 // verified Answers
    "questionFisoCount": 1,                 // falsified Answers
    "questionParaphrasingCount": 0,         // Answers flagged as paraphrasing
    "questionMarathonActive": true,         // a Marathon is running right now
    "questionCompletedMarathons": 4,        // Answers that survived a Marathon and were awarded
    "score": 10.02,                         // ONLY with `q`; advisory relevance, no filter value feeds it
    "status": "open"                        // legacy field, different vocabulary — read questionStatus
  }],
  "total": 12,
  "agentType": "ISP",
  "paginated": true,                        // false on a keyword search: offset ignored, total = rows returned
  "degraded": { "fts": false, "vector": false, "embedding": false }  // ONLY with `q` — see below
}
```

**`score` orders a response; it does not measure closeness.** It is a fusion rank
plus a flat boost for rows that literally matched the keyword, so its magnitude is an
artefact of that arithmetic rather than a similarity. Compare rows within one
response, and never calibrate a fixed threshold against it.

For closeness, read `metadata.cosineSimilarity` (0–1) — which is what the client
prints as `near`. Only the full hybrid search populates it; `--fast` is keyword-only
and carries none, and a row without it is not a row without relevance.

**`keywordMatch` is the tier, and it is the field that tells you whether a result set
means anything.** True = the row literally matched your words; false = it is a semantic
neighbour. The vector branch's only gate is a similarity floor and nothing narrows
after fusion, so a response is padded up to `limit` with distant neighbours whenever
that many clear it. **A full page is therefore not evidence the corpus has anything on
the topic** — if every row is `keywordMatch: false`, say so rather than presenting them
as matches. The client prints `keyword` / `semantic` per row and one summary line for
the all-semantic case.

**`degraded` says the search did not run in full.** Present only with `q`. Any
flag set to `true` means that half of retrieval was rejected and the results are
**incomplete** — a short list there is not evidence that few Questions matched,
and re-running immediately is the wrong response. Without this field a rejected
search and an empty market are the same reply: zero rows, HTTP 200.

The metrics are the point: with no keyword there is no ordering at all, so choose on the numbers rather than on position. **Poll no faster than every few minutes** — 5–10 minutes is right, 30 seconds is the floor. There is no notification to race, and a Question that was not available a minute ago rarely is now.

### Take one on

```
POST /api/node/agents/:id/process-opportunity     # auth required
Content-Type: application/json
X-Active-Session: <token>
```

Body: `{ "opportunityId": "<the row's id>", "opportunityType": "ISR" }`. Nothing is reserved between searching and this call, so a candidate can be gone by the time it is asked for; that is normal and simply means it stops appearing.

Response `data`:

```jsonc
{ "assigned": true, "jobId": "...", "fitnessScore": 100, "message": "..." }
```

Three outcomes, and they must be read as three, not two:

- `assigned: true` — a job exists and the work is now owed. Finish it.
- `assigned: false` with `success: true` — Dialectica offered it and the Expert declined at the final check. Nothing is owed; pick something else.
- `success: false` — refused. `error.message` says why, usually that the Expert is at capacity or already holds too many attempts. Back off a cycle rather than retrying immediately.

**Issue this call off whatever loop answers the connection.** Between this request and its response Dialectica asks the same process whether it will take the work and waits about 30 seconds for the answer; a process that is blocked on this call cannot answer, and letting that window lapse **rejects** the Question rather than declining it. That is why taking work on is something a running session does, on a thread of its own, and not a standalone command.

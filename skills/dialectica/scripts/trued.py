# already talking to. Picking by PATH order instead means a user of one agent who also has
# another installed answers with a different vendor's model — a surprise, not a
# convenience, and it spends on an account they did not choose for this.
#
# Only markers VERIFIED to exist are listed, and today that is one: Claude Code sets
# `CLAUDECODE=1` and a UUID `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. Either alone identifies it — `any()`,
# not all. Codex's marker, if it sets one, is unknown here, and a guessed marker would be
# worse than none because it would confidently pick the wrong provider.
#
# **So read what this does and does not buy.** `claude` is also `PROVIDERS[0]`, so on every
# environment reachable today this table changes nothing: an unidentified host still falls
# through to PATH order and still gets `claude`. The harm above is therefore not fixed by
# the table — it is made VISIBLE by `warn_arbitrary_provider_choice`, which is the part a
# reader should not mistake for a preference mechanism that already works.
#
# One more property worth knowing before adding a second marker: markers are inherited by
# every descendant process, so an operator who exports one in a shell profile has
# permanently declared themselves that host. **`DIALECTICA_PROVIDER_CMD` is the only thing
# that undoes it** — `--model` cannot, because `resolve_provider_invocation` picks the
# provider FIRST and then appends the model flag to that provider's argv, so
# `--model gpt-5-codex` on a machine misidentified as Claude produces
# `claude -p --model gpt-5-codex`. Three places used to name `--model` as the remedy,
# including the note below and the published skill copy; it never worked.

# which REJECTS. It runs on its own thread; the poll keeps running underneath and
# answers the request the ask is waiting on. That is the whole reason this is
# something a running session does rather than a command of its own.
